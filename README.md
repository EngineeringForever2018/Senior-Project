# AVPD

Note: The commit history for this repostory is inaccurate and does not reflect everyone's contributions. This is because, especially in the beginning of the project, the repostory has mainly been used only by Gage in order to save everyone's work and allow for rollbacks if necessary, and keep a history of commits that he worked on. In addition, a very large amount of commits that were authored by Gage were actually collaborative commits done through pair programming, and this was before we knew about co-authoring commits. An attempt was made to edit the git history to properly credit everyone for their work, but we currently find this infeasible due to an extremely large amount of merge conflicts that occur when we attempt this.
